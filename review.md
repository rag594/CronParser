## Review for parser/dayOfWeekParser.go


The provided code appears to be a parser for a cron expression that includes day of week information. Here are some suggestions for improvement:

1. Use a more descriptive variable name than `c`. `parser` would be a more appropriate name since it describes the purpose of the variable.
2. Use meaningful variable names for the methods. For example, instead of using `WildCardParser`, use `parseWildcard` to make the method name more descriptive and easier to understand.
3. Use a consistent naming convention throughout the code. Some variables have camelCase names while others have underscore_names. It's better to be consistent with either convention.
4. Remove any dead code or unused variables. For example, the `x` variable in the `parse()` method is not used anywhere.
5. Avoid using magic numbers and instead use constants or named values for the different parts of the cron expression. This makes the code more readable and easier to maintain.
6. Instead of using a hardcoded array with all the days of the week, consider using the `time` package's functions to generate the list of days. For example:
```
func (p *CronDayOfWeekParser) parseWildcard() []string {
    today := time.Now()
    return []string{strconv.Itoa(today.Weekday())}
}
```
This approach ensures that the code is always up-to-date with the current day of the week and also makes it easier to test.
7. Avoid using `fmt.Println` in the production code. Instead, use a logging library or an error handling mechanism to handle any errors that may occur.
8. Use a more descriptive variable name for the `DayOfWeekToNumEncoding` map. `dayOfWeekMapping` would be a more appropriate name since it describes what the map contains.
9. Consider using a struct to represent the different parts of the cron expression instead of using separate variables for each part. This will make the code easier to read and maintain. For example:
```
type CronExpression struct {
    DaysOfWeek []string
}
```
This approach will also allow you to add more fields to the struct in the future if needed without changing the existing code.
10. Use a consistent naming convention for the methods. Some methods have camelCase names while others have underscore_names. It's better to be consistent with either convention.

Here is an example of how the code could be improved:
```
package parser

import (
    "time"
)

type CronDayOfWeekParser struct {
    DaysOfWeek []string
}

func (p *CronDayOfWeekParser) Parse() []string {
    today := time.Now()
    return p.parseWildcard(today)
}

func (p *CronDayOfWeekParser) parseWildcard(today time.Time) []string {
    return []string{strconv.Itoa(today.Weekday())}
}
```
